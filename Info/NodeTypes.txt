Forms:
* base: Tabs are better than spaces for indentation.
* negation: Spaces are better than tabs for indentation.
* yes-no question [between variants (eg. "Are tabs better than spaces for indentation?" and its reverse), we choose the variant with the most support]

A top-level claim (ie, hosted on a category) must either be an answer to a multi-choice question, or shown in yes-no-question form. (making them more neutral)

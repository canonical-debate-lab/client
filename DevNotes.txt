This document will contain random notes that have a chance of being useful sometime in the future.

* Newer versions of Webpack apparently need webpack-cli installed locally.
* If you update Webpack, remember to update both WebpackConfig.js *and* Vendors.webpack.js.
* If you have issues with some json files not loading in new Webpack, try adding the path to json-loader's "include" array.
* If you get a ".js?[hash]" error, most likely it's just a cache issue. Try removing/renaming "node_modules/.cache".
* If something uses {flex: 1} in its style, remember to wrap the style object in an ES(...) call. This fixes the issue in Firefox, where {flex: 1} also sets {minWidth: auto}.
* Decided to transition away from using node-ui-locking. I've discovered that having node-ui request the not-yet-loaded data causes it to be downloaded much sooner than if it were to just be pushed by server generically.
